## Docker Learning Repository

### Emulating Network Requests

This repository serves as a practical learning resource for building Docker images with Go.

#### Using `test.rest` for Network Emulation

To simulate network requests, akin to services like POSTMAN, we utilize `test.rest`. To employ these RESTful functionalities:

##### 1. Install REST Client Extension

Ensure you have the REST Client extension installed in Visual Studio Code.

##### 2. Setup Docker

Ensure Docker is installed on your computer.

##### 3. Start Docker Services

Execute `docker-compose up`.

##### 4. Send Requests

Utilize the provided `test.rest` file to send requests and interact with the services.
